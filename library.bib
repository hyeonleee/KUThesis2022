% In BWH games, pools attacks each other and it affects to their revenue and consequently their attractiveness for miners
% used Reinforcement Learning for the BWH game
% big mining pools (1st, and 2nd) can affect the mining game significantly (possibility of being majority)
% mentioned they need a solution to prevent the attack without any change in the protocol -> our result!

% Related program : Blockdata
% Blockdata conducted an assessment of various blockchain technologies to support data integrity for distributed sensors. Blockchain technologies serve as the basis for the increasingly popular digital currency systems such as Bitcoin and Ether. The features of blockchain’s underlying technology can be used to ensure data integrity for sensors and their processed data sets. The Blockdata project assessed different blockchain technologies being developed in the commercial sector, and explored applicability, performance, and adaptability for joint warfighter applications. The project identified initial application areas and transitioned to a classified DoD agency.
